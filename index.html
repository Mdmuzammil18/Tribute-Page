          <p id= "img-caption"> "India's Greatest Mathematician" </p></div>
            <p><strong>1887</strong> - Born in Erode, Madras </p>
            <p><strong>1913</strong> -  Began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England.
            </p>
            <p><strong>1916</strong> - Awarded a Bachelor of Science degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) for his work on highly composite numbers.</p>
          <p>He had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered.<br>
              
              Ramanujan was plagued by health problems throughout his life. His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion there and because of wartime rationing in 1914â€“18. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a severe vitamin deficiency, and confined to a sanatorium.</p>
            <p><strong>1919</strong> - Returned to  Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency from England.</p>
          <p><strong>1920</strong> - Died at the age of 32.</p>
              <p>Ramanujan has been described as a person of a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners. He lived a simple life at Cambridge. Ramanujan's first Indian biographers describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his family goddess, Namagiri Thayar (Goddess Mahalakshmi) of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said he dreamed of blood drops that symbolised her consort, Narasimha. Afterward he would receive visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes.<br> He often said,<strong> "An equation for me has no meaning unless it represents a thought of God.</strong></p>
